## An R package for processing biodiversity data

This package was intended for processing biodiversity data, specifically for creating rank abundance graphs and comparing biodiversity assemblages with abiotic parameters using genetic data from environmental DNA. This R package will clean your data and will use your data to generate NMDS plots, rank abundance graphs, ANOVAs, and maps. This package was created for a biological data analysis class.
