This package was intended for processing biodiversity data, specifically for creating rank abundance graphs and comparing biodiversity assemblages with abiotic parameters using genetic data from environmental DNA. This R package will clean your data and will use your data to generate NMDS plots, rank abundance graphs, ANOVAs, and maps. This package was created for a biological data analysis class.
